Here’s a **very simple, pral way** to create a file, add content, and push it using Git 

---

### 1️⃣ Create a new file

```bash
touch demo.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ Add content to the file

```bash

echo "Hello Git" > demo.txt
```

👉 This writes text into the file.

(OR edit manually)

```bash
vi demo.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Check Git status

```bash
git status
```

---

### 4️⃣ Add file to staging area

```bash
git add demo.txt
```

(OR add all files)

```bash
git add .
```

---

### 5️⃣ Commit the changes

```bash
git commit -m "Added demo file with content"
```

---

### 6️⃣ Push to remote repository (optional)

```bash
git push origin main
```

(or `master`, based on your branch)

---

### 🔹 One-line quick method (commonly used)

```bash
echo "Hello Git" > demo.txt && git add demo.txt && git commit -m "Added demo file"
```
